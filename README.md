# Book-Management-System
My take on a small application "Book Management System". This application shows the Book details insertion using form HTML form and data processing and manipulation using PHP.

Here, I have made use of JavaScript and CSS to make the system look more appealing, also I have added the required syntax for form validation, data insertion and html form.

# View
The index.php have two Buttons: ADD BOOKS and VIEW BOOKS
Click on each button to see the designated requirement.

## How to Run
Start Xampp server, download zip or clone this repository and run index file directly.
